        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="subtext">Why should you check this out?</p>
        <p>Well I know for a reason that you don’t have anything better to do since we’ve submitted or have prepared the evidence.  I’m just saying to check it out for five minutes and then focus on your “YouTube” channel and post Fortnite gameplays just as the hype is going down.</p>
        <p class="subtext">Why did I make this, instead of using Instagram?</p>
        <p>That would've been way easier and better but, it wouldn’t be that exciting now would it.</p>
        <p class="subtext">Too Embarrassed?</p>
        <p>You should know that I will take down any image that you are in and are extremely uncomfortable with it being here. Just email me at cyberpunkcuber@gmail.com and include the image name and your name. However, please don’t get that offended by it. These pictures are just a reminder of our fun times. We will soon be going to A Levels and the going just gets tougher from here. You can also send anything that can improve the website, such as the color scheme, etc. Anything else that is sent to my email will be blocked.</p>
        <p class="subtext">Who am I?</p>
        <p>I am your fellow schoolmate who is just bored sitting at home and not seeing the light of day for nearly 3 months. But, instead of playing Fortnite and posting those videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTelSloT4ksoZ9e_6cg5NqQ" class="channel-link">YouTube</a>, I decided to do something with the things Mr. Mamun taught us. I do play Krunker though.</p>
        <p class="subtext">Disclaimer</p>
        <p>This has been built only for phones. So press Alt + F4 thrice and hit Enter if you are on a computer or throw your tablet across the room and use your phone. You have to keep in mind that if you have a slow connection the pages will load slowly. Also, this website is only for school photos and nothing else. However, in the case that it shows something else, that means this website has been hacked and you should never come back here. I won’t take any responsibility for that, I don’t want to end up like Anas.</p>
